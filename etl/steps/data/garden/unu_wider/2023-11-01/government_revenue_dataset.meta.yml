  revenue: >-
    Revenue refers to total government revenue, providing a set of variables that differentiates
    between sources and sub-components considered. Revenue contains four sub-components,
    namely:


    (i) Taxes;
    (ii) Non-Tax Revenue;
    (iii) Social Contributions;
    (iv) Grants.


    The variable Taxes captures tax collected regardless of sources (i.e., unless otherwise defined, this
    includes resource-based taxes). These follow the definition of taxes found in both the IMF’
    Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) and OECD Revenue Statistics Interpretive Guide
    as ‘compulsory, unrequited …’ payments to the government (IMF 2014; OECD 2020).
    Non-tax revenue includes all other revenue that is collected by governments that does not classify
    as either a tax, social contribution, or grant. According to IMF (2014:85), non-tax revenue captures
    ‘… property income, sales of goods and services, fines, penalties, and forfeits, transfers not
    elsewhere classified and premiums, fees, and claims related to nonlife insurance and standardized
    guarantee schemes.’
    Social contributions include both compulsory and voluntary social insurance contributions from
    employers, employees, and the self-employed.
    Grants include transfers from other government
    units (foreign) and international organisations. Regarding natural resources, please note that they
    refer to natural resources that include a significant component of economic rent, primarily from
    oil and mining activities.

  total_taxes: >-
    The Taxes variables presents aggregate indicators that capture all tax revenue as defined above.
    Resource taxes typically present taxes levied on natural resource extraction, although differ across
    territories. Resource Taxes are not (systematically) defined or captured in the OECD Revenue
    Statistics, and not captured at all in the IMF’s GFS, thus do not have a separate code for either
    publication.

  direct_taxes: >-
    Direct taxes include taxes on income, profits and capital gains, taxes on payroll and workforce as
    well as taxes on property. Please note that the total values of direct taxes (total direct tax
    mentioned in all variables listed below) may sometimes exceed the sum of the
    aforementioned sub-components, owing to revenue that is unclassified among these subcomponents. When specified as direct taxes excluding resource revenue, direct taxes comprise
    non-resource taxes on the mentioned sub-components (e.g., excluding corporate taxes accruing
    from entities engaged in the extraction of natural resource).

  taxes_income_profits_capital_gains: >-
    Taxes on income, profits, and capital gains (TIPCG) are always reported exclusive of social
    contributions. The total value of TIPCG may sometimes exceed the sum of the positions displayed
    in individuals and corporations and other enterprises, due to revenues that are unallocated between the
    two.

  taxes_payroll_workforce:
    Total taxes on payroll and workforce are always reported excluding social contributions, although
    in underlying sources, for certain countries, there is an element of conflation between the reporting
    of social contributions and payroll taxes; see McNabb (2017).

  taxes_property:
    This variable displays the total taxation on property, comprising mostly recurrent taxes on
    immovable property and net wealth, estate, inheritance and gift taxes, capital levies and other
    recurrent taxes on property. Note that the OECD’s revenue statistics class taxes on financial and
    capital transactions as a property tax, whilst the IMF’s GFSM 2014 does not.4 In the name of
    consistency, these are removed from the property tax figure for OECD countries and placed into
    taxes and goods and services; see McNabb (2017) for a fuller discussion.

  indirect_taxes: >-
    Indirect taxes comprise the sum of taxes on goods and services, international trade and
    transactions, and other taxes. The position displayed in Indirect may exceed the sum of mentioned
    sub-components due to unallocated revenue not classified in any of these categories. Note that the
    component of indirect taxes from natural resources is only non-zero in a small number of cases.

  taxes_goods_services:
    The majority of taxes on goods and services is comprised of sales taxes, value-added taxes (VAT)
    and excise duties. The OECD’s Revenue Statistics classes taxes on international trade and
    transactions under taxes on goods and services; thus for the GRD it is stripped out and reallocated
    as shown below. Note that the total of ‘Taxes on Goods and Services’ may be greater than the
    sum of the subcomponents due to unallocated residual revenues. Note also that, historically, a
    large number of countries classed VAT and Excise duty collected on imports as trade taxes. Both
    the IMF and OECD classify these as taxes on goods and services, and thus fall in this category. In
    the GRD, where it has not been possible to make this correction—primarily where historical
    Article IV data is involved—a note has been added to the relevant observations.

  taxes_trade: |
    Taxes on international trade include taxes on imports and exports.

  taxes_other: >-
    Total other taxes comprises tax revenues that are not otherwise classified, or identified. Often this
    incorporates, amongst other items, certain stamp duties.

  non_tax_revenue: >-
    These variables represent the non-tax components of government revenues. Total non-tax
    revenue is generally based on data categorized as either ‘non-tax revenue’ or ‘other revenue’
    depending on the underlying source.

  social_contributions: >-
    The variable for social contributions captures all social contributions remitted to government,
    either by employees, employer or the self-employed. This category also includes voluntary and
    imputed social contributions.

  grants: >-
    Grants include transfers from other government units (foreign) and international organisations.
    Whilst it is possible that at subnational levels of government, grants might also include
    intragovernmental grants, these are ‘netted out’ at the general government level and it is unlikely
    that grants would flow from state or local governments to the central government (the other level
    at which the GRD reports).
