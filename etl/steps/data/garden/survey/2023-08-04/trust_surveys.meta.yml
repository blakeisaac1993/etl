  title: Trust questions in the European Social Survey and several regional barometers (OWID, 2023)
  description: |
    This dataset combines trust questions from the European Social Survey (ESS) and several regional barometers.

    The main question in the dataset relates to interpersonal trust:
    - ESS: "Would you say that most people can be trusted or that you cannot be too careful?"
    - Latinobar贸metro: "Would you say that you can trust most people, or that you can never be too careful in dealing with others?"

    Though in the ESS the question is asked in a 0-10 scale, we only consider the answers from 6 to 10 as "agreeing" that most people can be trusted. In the Latinobar贸metro, we only consider the answers "One can trust most people" as "agreeing" that most people can be trusted.
