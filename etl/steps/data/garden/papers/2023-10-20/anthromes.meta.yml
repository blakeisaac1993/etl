      Academy of Sciences doi: 10.1073/pnas.2023483118.

      This repository contains the full Anthromes-12k-DGG dataset in .csv format for all three uncertainty levels (baseline,
      lower and upper), as well as the an12_dgg_inputs shapefile containing the discrete global grid polygons and supplemental
      data which can be joined to the .csv files for mapping. See the included README file for details of the included datasets.

      Please refer to the associated R analysis code and research compendium at doi:10.7910/DVN/6FWPZ9 for the associated
      anthrome class names and example code for working with these data in R.
