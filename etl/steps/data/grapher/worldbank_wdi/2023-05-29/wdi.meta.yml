        description_key:
          - GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP) is a measure of the average economic output per person, adjusted for price differences across countries.
          - This data is expressed in international dollars, a hypothetical currency that has the same purchasing power parity that the U.S. dollar had in the United States at a given point in time.
        description_from_producer: GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the country plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2017 international dollars.
