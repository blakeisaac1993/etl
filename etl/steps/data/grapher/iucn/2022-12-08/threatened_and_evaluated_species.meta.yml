        description: >-
          The IUCN Red List has assessed only a small share of the total known species in the world. This means the number
          of species threatened with extinction is likely to be a significant underestimate of the total number of species
          at risk.


          This is particularly true for understudied groups such as insects, plants and fungi.


          The share of known species threatened with extinction is only available for a few taxonomic groups where more than
          80% of species have been assessed.


          'Threatened' species are those that are categorized as 'Critically endangered', 'Endangered' or 'Vulnerable' on
          the IUCN Red List.

          The 'mushrooms' taxonomic group includes brackets, rusts, smuts and, jelly fungi.
