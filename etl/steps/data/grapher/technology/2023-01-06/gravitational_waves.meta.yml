      description: |
        The Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (GWOSC) provides public access to gravitational-wave data. This data is collected by LIGO, Virgo, GEO600, and KAGRA, which are all large-scale physics experiments designed and constructed to observe gravitational waves.

        The GWTC (Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog) is a cumulative set of gravitational wave transients maintained by GWOSC. It contains confidently-detected gravitational wave observations.

        The sources notes that this catalog is only updated periodically, and may not contain recently-published events.
