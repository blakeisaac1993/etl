  description: |
    The HadCRUT5 near surface temperature data set is produced by blending data from the CRUTEM5 surface air temperature dataset and the HadSST4 sea-surface temperature dataset.

    Temperature anomalies are based on the HadCRUT5 near-surface temperature dataset as published by the Met Office Hadley Centre. Temperature anomalies are given in degrees celsius relative to the average temperature over the period 1961-1990.

    These are available for the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. The global mean has been calculated by averaging anomalies for northern and southern hemispheres.
